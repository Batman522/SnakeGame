# Snake Game

A classic Snake game built using Pygame in Python. This project includes features such as a main menu, a scoring system, and a game over screen with options to play again or quit.

## Features

- **Main Menu**: Start the game from a simple main menu with a "Play Game" button.
- **Gameplay**: Control the snake using arrow keys. The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- **Scoring System**: The score increases as the snake eats food, and it is displayed on the screen during gameplay.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays the final score and provides options to "Play Again" or "Quit".
